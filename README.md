# virtualcomputer

This is the Virtual Computer created and used by St Kwan's Home for the Terminally ADD. There are many like it, but this one is mine. Its purpose is to teach assembly language from the point of view of the processor itself, by implementing a processor in software. We start out with a minimal set of features and instructions which can do something useful, but design with expansion in mind. There is plenty of memory, plenty of registers, and plenty of opcode space.
